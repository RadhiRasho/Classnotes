# Math 1700 - Project 2

## Introduction

This project explores the use of Series in safe and effective dosage of drugs calculations. When a single dose of drug is administered, the drug concentration in the bloodstream can be modeled as a series. The dosage is lost slowly over time, and the concentration can be modeled as a series of decreasing terms.

## Model for Effect of Repeated Doses

$$
\LARGE
 R_n = C_0e^{-kt_0} + C_0e^{-2kt_0} + \ldots + C_0e^{-nkt_0}
$$

Where:

- $\large C_0$ is the change in concentration achievable by a single dose (mg/mL)
- $\large k$ is the elimination constant ($h^{-1}$)
- $\large t_0$ is the time between doses ( $h$ )

## Graph of Concentration vs Time Pertaining to a Single Dose
