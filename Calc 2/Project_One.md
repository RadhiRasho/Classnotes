# Math 1700 - Project 1

## Introduction

The project explores the Normal Probability Distribution and acts as a proof/argument of the theory that the area under the curve of the Normal Probability Distribution is equal to 1.

## Normal Probability Distribution

$$
\Large
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

The function above is called the Normal probability density function with the mean $\large \mu$ and the standard deviation $\large \sigma$. The number $\large \mu$ tells where the distribution is centered, and $\large \sigma$ measures the "scatter" around the mean.

From the theory of probability, it is known that:

$$
\Large
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx = 1
$$

## Graphical Representation

### $A)$ Graph of $\large f$. Find the interval on which the $\large f$ is increasing, the interval on which $\large f$ is decreasing, and any extreme values and where they occur.

The graph of the function $\large f$ is shown below:

The graph is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, 0)$ and decreasing on the interval $(0, \infty)$. There is a Local Maximum at $x = 0$.
